<p>When most people hear the term "social network", they usually think of online social media. Thats because online social networks, also known as social-networking sites, have been very popular recently. Sites like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, have been the most popular in recent years. Several features of online social networks are common to each of the more than 300 social networkng sites. The most basic, but most important ability is to make your own profile. This can include a profile, basic information, name, age, and gender.</p>

<p>Most social networks allow you to post photos, videos, music, and even personal blogs on your profile page. But the main feature is the ability to find and make friends with other site members. The friends you make also appear as links on your profile page so people can easily browse your online friend network. Each online social network has different ways to connect to online friends. Myspace is the most open. On myspace you can search and contact anyone across the entire network, even if they're complete strangers. But to get full acecess to thier profile you first have to become friends with that person, and the only way to do that is if they accept youur request.</p>

<p>Another social media site, known as "Facebook" is the most popular social media network of all time. It started as a college social network application, but grew to become the biggest site, now worth 350 million dollars. Facebook is more group oriented. On facebook you can only search for people in your established networks. Those networks include the company you work for, your high school, or the college you attended. Or you can even join smaller groups that have already be created by Facebook users, some are even based on real-life organizations, and some that exsist only in the minds of the founders.</p>

<p>LinkedIn, the most popular online social network for business professionals, allows you to search each and every site member, but you can only access the full profiles and contact information of your established contacts, the people who have accepted an invitation to join your network, or the people who have invited you to join theirs. You can be introduced through your contacts to people who are two or three degrees away from you on the larger LinkedIn network. Or you can pay extra to contact any user directly through a service called InMail.</p>
