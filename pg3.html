<h1>How Search Engines Work on the Internet</h1>
<center><img src="http://outdatedbrowser.com/public/imgs/browsers-bg.png" width="700" height="200">
<p>The World Wide Web is an information system on the Internet that allows documents to be connected to other documents by links, enabling the user to search for information by moving from one document to another. There are hundreds of millions of pages available, waiting to present information on a variety of topics. The bad news about the Internet is that there are hundreds of millions of pages available, most of them titled according to the notion of the author, almost all of them sitting on servers with cryptic names. If you need to find something out, use a search engine. Search engines are special sites on the Web that are designed to help people find information stored on other sites. There are differences in the ways various search engines work, but they all perform three basic tasks. They all search the internet, they keep a index of words they find, and they all allow users to look up words or combinations of words found in that index</p>
<h1>Search Engines</h1>

<p>Google's search engine is the most powerful and most popular. Google is now worth around 527 billion! Without search engines like Google, it would be almost impossible to find what you need when you search for something on the web. Like all search engines, Google uses a special algorithm to generate search results. While Google shares general facts about its algorithm, the specifics are a company secret. This helps Google remain competitive with other search engines on the web and reduces the chance of someone finding out how to abuse the system.</p>

<p>Apple Safari is a web browser powered by Apple. Safari has been designed based on the premise that the most useful browser is one that "gets out of you way and lets you enjoy the web." Safari is currently the fourth position in the browser market behind, Internet Explorer, Mozilla, Firefox, and Google Chrome. At the heart of Apple's Safari browser is the WebKit engine, which is responsible for functions like displaying graphics, rendering fonts, running javascript and determining page layout. Future versions of Safari are expected to use Apple's WebKit2 engine, which features a split process model built directly into the framework that enables Web browser processes to run as separate processes in the operating system for improved stability and security.</p>

<p>Internet Explorer is the third most popular search engine, its a web browser that made its debut in 1995 as Microsoft's response to Netscape, one of the first graphical-based Web browsers and at the time, the dominant browser in use with control of over 90 percent of the market. As with most modern browsers, Internet Explorer supports Java, JavaScript, ActiveX, RSS, CSS and Ajax, while also offering features like tabbed browsing, private browsing, and built-in malware and phishing protection.</p>
