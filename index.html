<h1>How does the Internet Work?</h1>
<center><img src="http://s.hswstatic.com/gif/internet-diagram.gif" width="700" height="300">
<p>The internet can be a confusing place unless you understand how it actually works. To understand how it works, it would help if you cut it down into two main components. The first component that helps makes the internet work would be the hardware. The hardware is everything from the cables to the routers. The cables main priority is to send terabits of information to your computer. More pieces of hardware include, the routers, servers, and satellites. The main purpose of the hardware is to link or share information from one device to another. Your computer is sort of like a chain, your computer is connected to a router through cables or wifi, the router is connected to the server, and the server is connected to other computers.</p>
<h1>How does it communicate correctly?</h1>
<p>In order for it to work correctly the network protocols need to be in place. Network protocols are commomnly known as "transmission control Protocols", and "internet protocols". These are mainly the rules that the computer follows to complete certain tasks. These protocols provide a computer language between computers which allow for clear instructions and transmissions for them. When you send or get information from computers, this information still needs to be gathered though, this is where servers come in handy. Servers are what recieves the protocol instructions from your computer, when you enter a website. </p>

<p>The server operates as a go-between computers, and will act as a directory to match up the domain name you requested. The request will eventually arrive to your web server through a transmission known as"packets". Packets are pretty much data files with information that range between 1,000 and 1,500 bytes. Protocols will then arrange the information packets in the correct order, and will even deliver them in a consistent manner to your computer and your screen.</p>
<h1>Ways to Connect to the Internet</h1>
Some people might think that the only way to connect to the internet is by wiring their computer directly into their modem, but there is another simple way, and that is through wireless internet. Meaning that you can access the internet from anywhere inside the boudaries of your router. The way wireless internet works is instead of plugging your computer into the modem, you plug in a piece of equipment called a router. A routerâ€™s function is to relay the internet signal to a wireless card which is either plugged into your computer, or already built in to your computer.</p>
